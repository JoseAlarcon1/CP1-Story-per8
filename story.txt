I woke up
I walked my dog Logan
I ate breakfast
I went to school
I went to period 1
I went to period 2
We were supposed to have a test today.
"Oh, no! I forgot to study," the class including me exclaimed.
During taking the test, the fire alarm started blasting.
We ran out excited, knowing that we didn't have to finish the test.
It started snowing as I set foot in the cold.
The coldness of the snow was able to burn out the fire inside. "*WOW!*" we all yelled.
So we had to immdeaitely go bakc inside with enough time to finish the test.
As we miserably walked back into the school, a bird flew into the building.
It landed into the wall, and, on impact, triggered the fire alarm.
This time, the sprinklers started throughout the school.
We had to spend the rest of the period starting a fire to burn out the ice that was created.
At least, now I had time to study for the take makeup.
