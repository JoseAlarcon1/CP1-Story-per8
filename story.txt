I woke up
I walked my dog Logan
I ate breakfast
I went to school
I went to period 1
I went to period 2
I went to period 3
I went to period 4
I went to period 5
I went to period 6
I went to period 7
I was flying in the sky with the wonderful birds and almost crashed into a building because mustard got into my eyes. I was then traumatized and had to go to the hospital for the night.
I sat through some amazing classes
I came home from school
I walked Logan again
I ate dinner
I watched a movie
I went to sleep
